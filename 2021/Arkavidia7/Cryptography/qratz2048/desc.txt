qratz2048 - 500pts

Last year, pqrsen wasn't solved using the intended solution because I forgot to patch & put constraints to my challenge when doing some changes. So I create a cryptosystem based on it.

Hopefully, it's working this time! And don't even try to bruteforce 15 alphanumeric & case-sensitive chars!
